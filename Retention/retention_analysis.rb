#================================oOo===================================
# This script helps you figure out how many entities that do an activity in a given week do an activity (not neccessarily the same one) in subsequent weeks
# For example, for users that create account in a given week, how many of them login in subsequent weeks since their signup date
# This is commonly used for rentention analysis aka cohort analysis
# You must have event data stored in Keen IO in order to run this analysis
# The program uses the Keen IO funnel analysis API to do the calculations
# The analysis can go back any num_weeks in the past and will run analysis for each week since that time (one cohort for each week)
# The results will be outputted to Terminal and also an excel file
# The total number of funnel analyses is num_weeks^2/2 so the query can take some time
#================================oOo===================================

# Step 1 - Determine how far back in the past you want to go for this analysis.
# Calculations will be run for every week since that week, up until the most recent completed week.

num_weeks = 15

# Step 2 - Enter your Keen Project Info

$projectID = "<your project ID>"
$key = "<your API key>"
$api_version = "3.0"   # You probably don't need to change this
$api_url = "https://api.keen.io" # You probably don't need to change this

# Step 3 - Define your funnel steps. The first step will define your cohort groups. The last step will determine your "success" criteria.
# For example, say you are interested in login activity for customers who have paid
# step one: Submit Payment (groups customers based on the week they paid)
# step two: Login (counts how many of those customers logged in since the week they paid)
# Add any number of filters to any step (e.g. exclude test accounts).

$steps = [
    {
     :event_collection => "<the name of the collection to use for the first step of your funnel>",  # e.g. signup, create_account
     :actor_property => "<the name of the event property you use to uniquely identify the account or user>",  #e.g. organization.id, user.id 
     #:filters => [{                                    
     #           :property_name => "organization.name",   # you can optionally apply filters to any step of the funnel to exclude events
     #           :operator => "ne",
     #           :property_value => "Test"
     #           }],
     },
     {
     :event_collection => "<the name of the collection to use for the second step of your funnel, the engagement activity>", #e.g. submit_content, login, share, post
     :actor_property => "<the name of the event property you use to uniquely identify the account or user>", #needs to have the same type of values as the actor_property in step 1 
     },
 ]

# Protip: You may have more than two steps. Middle steps will further refine the number of candidates which make it to the last step.
# Step 4 - Run this script!
